# The Wanderer and the Waste
A game for 2 people

## About
_The Wanderer and the Waste_ is a game for 2 people. One person is the **Wanderer**, the other the **Waste**.    
The **Wanderer** and the **Waste** are adversaries, but not competitors.    
The goal is to tell a story about a perilous journey.

## Required Materials
A sheet of paper

An odd number of the same kind of dice. 7-9 six-sided dice should work.

## 0. Setup
Place the dice between the two players. The **Wanderer** begins:

* State who you are and the nature of your journey. Be descriptive, but not necessarily specific.

  _I am the rightful heir of the Kingdom, returning to claim my throne_

  _I am a merchant making my way through the Trackless Desert to sell my wares in the Grand Bazaar_

  _I am the last survivor of an expeditionary force, trying to reach those lights on the horizon_

* Take one die from the pile. State what **Provision** it represents, and note that on the paper. Roll the die, and place it next to its description on the paper.

  _I have years of survival training_

  _I have a sturdy ship_

  _I have sufficient food and water_

* When only one die remains, the **Wanderer**'s setup is complete.

The **Waste** states what they are and what they have, claiming the last die

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I am the sea, and I have a vast indiifference_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I am the Trackless Desert, and I have shifting sands_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I am Planet X37-B, and I have strange terrain_

_NB_: The **Waste** should complement the details provided by the **Wanderer**, both their introduction and their **Provisions**. If the **Wanderer** says they are
a sailor, don't make them trek across mountains, unless both players agree that would be more interesting. _Challenge, but collaborate._

## 1. Part 1  [**Katabasis**??]
The game is played as a series of **Challenges**. If both players so choose, the **Wanderer** may narrate the beginning of their journey. Otherwise, or afterward,
the **Waste** narrates a misfortune that befalls the **Wanderer**. These misfortunes should be more physical than mental&mdash;the **Waste** does not
get to decide _how_ the **Wanderer** feels about or reacts to a particular event. Similarly, **Challenges** should hinder, but not derail, the **Wanderer**'s
journey&mdash;while giving up or turning back is always an option, it should be but one of many, one the **Wanderer** has to deliberately _choose_.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_A violent sandstorm arises, stinging your eyes and blotting out the sun_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_You come to a canyon; the bridge has rotted away, rendering it useelss_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_As you make your way across the plateau, you attract the attention of the great winged beasts that make it their home_

When the **Waste** has finished narrating the event that precipitates the **Challenge**, they roll their die. If both players so choose, the result of the
roll may be cause to adjust or ret-con the narration of the event. The **Wanderer** then chooses one of their **Provisions**. If the die representing the
chosen _Provision_ is at least as high as the result of the **Challenge** roll, then the **Wanderer** has successfully used that **Provision** to ward off
the danger. Otherwise, their efforts are insufficient, and their journey may only continue at a cost. Either way, the **Wanderer** narrates what happened
and how their **Provision** played into the outcome, and then hands that die to the **Waste**. The **Waste** rolls both dice for the next **Challege**; the higher of
them is the result. If the **Wanderer** won the **Challenge**, they should also mark a **Waypoint** [get a better name] on the paper. This process continues
until half the **Wanderer**'s provisions have been consumed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_My ship is fast enough to outrun the pirates_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I trigger a few of my MREs, distracting the beasts long enough to find shelter in a cave_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The strange ores of the canyon confuse my navigator, forcing me to backtrack from a number of dead ends_

_NB_: The **Waste** adds the die representing each spent **Provision** to their pool, and roll
_all_ of them for the next **Challenge**. Only the highest counts; multiples don't have any effect.

## 2. **Oasis** [get a better name?]
When the **Wanderer** has used half their **Provisions**, they reach a respite--the **Oasis**. The **Waste** should narrate what this respite is, and how the **Wanderer**
comes across it. At this point, the **Wanderer** may choose to "re-stock" their **Provisions**: for each **Waypoint** they have marked, they may reroll one **Provision**.
If both players so choose, the new roll may represent an entirely new **Provision**, or simply an upgrade, resupply, or reinforcement of an existing one. _NB_: the
**Wanderer** _must_ accept the result of the new roll: not all benevolence is equal in merit.

## 3 Part 3 [**Anabasis**??]
Play continues as in Part 1, except ties now count as a defeat for the **Wanderer**.

## 4. Resolution
When the **Wanderer**'s **Provisions** have been entirely consumed, their journey has come to an end. Whether they have succeeded in reaching their destination is
up to the players, together.
